# What does a Data Analyst do? and it's roadmap?

## Two types of companies

1. Product based companies
   In product based companies, you'll have different products and departments.
2. Service based companies
   In service based companies, you'll have clients.

## Different phases when Data Science project comes:

1. **Requirement Gathering** :
   In this phase, two important group of people will be involved:
    - **Business Analyst**<br>
      Business Analyst is a team from the Data Science projects who will help you to understand the business problem.
    - **Domain Expert/ Product Owner**<br>
      Domain expert is particularly from client side. They have the entire idea about the products and what are the requirements is there to be solved.
2. **Data Analyst/ Data Scientist** :<br>
   All these requirements sent to Data Analyst/ Data Scientist.
   Again they do a discussion with a domain expert or product owner.The first thing they find out is that from where they have to probably consider the data.
   Data may be present in internal database, may be present in 3rd party cloud based API's.
   One more team is also involved in this phase - **Big Data Engineer**. After the data source is identified, they create a pipeline which is responsible for providing all the data for the data science project.
   After that data may be stored in MondoDB, MySQL, Cassandra, VectorDB, etc. as per the requirement.

### Once the data source is created, then we start the lifecycle of the data science project.

1. Data Analyst:<br>
    - Data analyst involved in **Feature Engineering**, cleaning the raw data.
    - Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Statistical Analysis**
    - Create **reports** using business intelligence and data visualization tools.
    - Report forwarded to the stakeholders who are controlling the entire business. From these reports they will be able to make business decisions.
